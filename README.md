## 📜 Overview

This repository is a **comprehensive and hands-on resource** for implementing **statistical tests** within modern **data analysis workflows**. It bridges the gap between **statistical theory** and **practical application** by providing **ready-to-use Python scripts** and **annotated Jupyter notebooks** designed to work with both **real-world** and **synthetically generated datasets**.

The structure and content of the repository are carefully organized to guide users from **basic descriptive statistics** to **advanced inferential testing**, covering concepts such as:

* Comparing group means and variances
* Testing relationships between variables
* Evaluating model assumptions before applying statistical methods
* Translating test results into **actionable business, scientific, or policy insights**

Whether your focus is **academic research**, **business intelligence**, **agriculture**, **healthcare**, or **general analytics**, this repository equips you with **clear, reusable, and scalable tools** for performing rigorous and interpretable statistical analyses.

## 🎯 Objectives

The **core mission** of this repository is to **demystify statistical testing** and make it a **reliable companion** in data-driven decision-making.

Key goals include:

1. **Practical Accessibility** – Provide ready-to-deploy scripts for **commonly used tests** (t-tests, ANOVA, correlation, regression diagnostics, non-parametric tests, etc.).
2. **Interpretation Beyond p-values** – Equip users with **statistical reasoning skills**, encouraging context-aware conclusions rather than blind reliance on significance thresholds.
3. **Workflow Integration** – Ensure that tests fit **seamlessly into data analysis pipelines**, from data cleaning to result reporting.
4. **Educational Clarity** – Combine **in-line explanations**, **interpretation guides**, and **best practices** so that both beginners and experienced analysts can benefit.
5. **Reusability and Scalability** – Provide well-structured code that adapts to **various datasets and domains** without heavy modification.

## 📦 Scope and Features

This repository goes beyond simple code snippets. It covers:

* **Descriptive Statistics** – Summarization of datasets with measures of central tendency, dispersion, and distribution shape.
* **Inferential Statistics** –

  * Parametric tests (t-tests, ANOVA, Pearson correlation)
  * Non-parametric tests (Mann–Whitney U, Kruskal–Wallis, Spearman correlation)
  * Proportion tests (Chi-square, Fisher’s Exact)
  * Regression diagnostics and residual analysis
* **Effect Size Metrics** – Quantifying the **magnitude** of observed effects to support practical significance.
* **Assumption Checking** – Ensuring conditions for valid statistical inference (normality, homogeneity, independence).
* **Data Visualization for Statistics** – Tailored plots to illustrate statistical findings (boxplots, violin plots, Q-Q plots, regression plots, confidence intervals).
* **Reproducible Jupyter Notebooks** – Combining **code, outputs, and commentary** for self-contained learning and reference.
